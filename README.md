* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Git/GitHub

The development of the Tasker software involved the use of key web development tools, 
ensuring a seamless and efficient creation process. Here's a brief overview of the primary tools employed in 
crafting this sophisticated financial tool:

##### HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
HTML serves as the foundational markup language for structuring the content and layout of the web application. It 
defines the basic building blocks of the Loan Calculator, such as input fields, buttons, and the overall document 
structure.

##### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS played a pivotal role in enhancing the aesthetic appeal and visual consistency of the Loan Calculator. By 
styling HTML elements, CSS ensured a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. It facilitated the 
customization of colors, fonts, and layout, contributing to an intuitive user experience.

##### JavaScript:
JavaScript, as the scripting language, brought interactivity and dynamic functionality to the Loan Calculator. 
Through JavaScript, we implemented the logic behind the calculations, converting user inputs into meaningful 
outputs. This includes the computation of monthly payments and total loan repayments based on the provided loan 
amount, interest rate, and loan term.
